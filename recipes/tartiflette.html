    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Tartiflette is the French culinary bear hug you didn’t know you needed. Imagine potatoes, crispy tofu, and onions, all smothered in a glorious amount of reblochon cheese. It's like the French looked at a potato bake and said, "This needs more cheese and a dash of attitude." Perfect for cheese enthusiasts. </p>
