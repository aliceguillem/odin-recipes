    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Imagine a party where the beef decides to go skinny dipping in a luxurious red wine bath, simmering away with a merry band of carrots, onions, and a sprinkle of thyme, like old friends gossiping in a hot tub. This concoction, known as boeuf bourguignon, is essentially the culinary equivalent of a beef's spa day, ending in a rich, tender transformation that's so delicious, it's almost scandalous. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p><em>Quantity for 4 to 6 people</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs beef chuck</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 bottle (750 ml) dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 lb pearl onions</li>
        <li>1/2 lb mushrooms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Beef:</strong> Season beef cubes generously with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in batches to avoid crowding, ensuring a good sear on all sides. Set browned beef aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté Vegetables:</strong> In the same pot, add another tablespoon of oil if necessary and sauté the diced onion and sliced carrots until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Deglaze and Simmer:</strong>  Pour in the red wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned bits. Add the beef back to the pot along with any accumulated juices. Stir in the beef broth, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it gently simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beef is very tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Roux for Thickening:</strong> Meanwhile, in a small pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly, to create a roux. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté Pearl Onions and Mushrooms:</strong> In another pan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms, sautéing until they are golden and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Once the beef is tender, stir in the roux to thicken the sauce. Add the caramelized pearl onions and mushrooms to the pot. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Let it simmer for another 10-15 minutes to blend the flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Discard the bay leaf. Serve your boeuf bourguignon hot, ideally with a side of creamy mashed potatoes or crusty bread to soak up the rich sauce.</li>
    </ol>
