    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>A French crêpe is like the quick-witted, slender sibling of the hefty American pancake, flipping effortlessly in pans with Parisian flair. It's so delicately thin, it whispers tales of culinary ballet, ready to envelope both the sweet whispers of Nutella and the savory secrets of cheese with equal grace. Essentially, it's the culinary world's versatile supermodel: effortlessly chic, impossibly thin, and endlessly adaptable. </p>

        <li><strong>preparation:</strong> 10 minutes;</li>
        <li><strong>total:</strong> 30 minutes;</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p><em>Quantity for 3 to 5 people</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt </li>
        <li>Optional: 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Batter:</strong> In a blender, combine the flour, milk, eggs, melted butter, and salt (or sugar and vanilla if making sweet crêpes). Blend until the mixture is smooth and bubbles form on top, about 30 seconds. Let the batter sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes, or refrigerate it for up to 1 day; stir again before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Heat a 9-inch non-stick skillet or crêpe pan over medium heat. Brush with a small amount of melted butter to lightly coat the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Crêpes:</strong> Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the pan, tilting and swirling the pan immediately to spread the batter evenly across the bottom. Cook until the edges of the crêpe begin to lightly brown, about 1 to 2 minutes. Then, using a spatula or your fingers, flip the crêpe and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute on the other side, until lightly golden. Remove and place on a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the pan as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill and Serve: </strong>Serve the crêpes warm with your favorite fillings. For sweet crêpes, consider Nutella, jam, whipped cream, fresh fruit, or a sprinkle of sugar and lemon juice. For savory ones, fill with cheese, ham, sautéed vegetables, or eggs. Fold the crêpes into quarters, roll them up, or simply fold them in half, depending on your filling. </li>
    </ol>
